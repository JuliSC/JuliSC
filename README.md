👋 Hi, I’m @JuliSC
A positive and enthusiastic developer with a love for the creative.

👀 I’m interested in making people smile. If that's through a wacky local coop game or a service that makes their life easier, doesn't matter. 
Seeing that spark in people's eyes when they're having a good time, with something YOU made... NOTHING beats that.

🌱 I’m currently learning Vue 3, Typescript, Tailwind CSS and how to properly test!

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything fun!
